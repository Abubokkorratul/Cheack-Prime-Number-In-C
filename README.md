Cheack Prime Number In C, from (n to n), Suppose 1-300

The prime number is the number that didn't divisible with 1 and the same number, 
suppose if I want to find 56 is prime , or not!, We need do divide from 2-55, if it possiable to divisible with this limit , then it's not prime.

so 
1.we need to check with a loop.
2.we use for loop or we can use while loop.
